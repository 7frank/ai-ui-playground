- decent interaction
- can edit files that they did not create
- resume feature broken at the time of testing

  Sure, I can help with that. Here's a high-level plan for creating a multiplayer tic-tac-toe game using TypeScript and   
  Node.js.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                          
  Plan:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                          
   1 Initialize a new Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies.                                             
   2 Create a simple HTTP server that allows two connections.                                                             
   3 Implement the game logic (tic-tac-toe rules)                                                                         
   4 Implement the multiplayer functionality.                                                                             
   5 Write unit tests for the game.                                                                                       
   6 Document the code with JSDoc                                                                                         
   7 Prepare Git Commit messages.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                          
  Let's get started.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                          
  ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓  
  ┃                  Step 1: Initialize a new Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies.                  ┃  
  ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛  
                                                                                                                          
  We will start by initializing a Node.js project and install the following dependencies: typescript, express for         
  creating an HTTP server easily, jest for unit testing, ts-jest for TypeScript compatibility in jest, and @types/jest    
  and @types/node for types definitions.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                          
  The next step will be creating a tsconfig.json file to specify the root files and the compiler options.                 
                                                                                                                          
  The final step on this setup will be creating a simple express server in TypeScript.                                    
                                                                                                                          
  To summarize, we will:                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                          
   • Initialize a new Node.js project.                                                                                    
   • Install the necessary dependencies.                                                                                  
   • Create a tsconfig.json for TypeScript configuration.                                                                 
   • Create a basic Express server in TypeScript.                                                                         
                                                                                                                          
  Let's do it.

  Great, we have initialized the project and installed the dependencies.                                                  
                                                                                                                          
  Next, let's generate tsconfig.json file to specify the root files and the compiler options. You configure the           
  TypeScript compiler by creating a tsconfig.json in the root of your project.                                            
                                                                                                                          
  Our tsconfig.json file will look something like this:

  It appears that we encountered an error because the file ./src/index.ts could not be found. This could be due to the    
  fact that the file has not been created yet or we are not in the right directory.                                       
                                                                                                                          
  Let's double-check whether we are inside the correct directory and whether the file has been created. I'll execute a    
  shell command to print the current working directory (using pwd) and list the contents of the src directory (using ls   
  src). This will help us figure out where we currently are and whether the src/index.ts file exists.                     
                                                                                                                          
  Let's run the code.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                          
  pwd && ls src                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                          
  /home/freimann/Projects/baby/ai-ui-playground/interpreter-test/tic-tac-toe                                              
  index.ts                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  The current working directory is /home/freimann/Projects/baby/ai-ui-playground/interpreter-test/tic-tac-toe, which is   
  correct. Also, the file index.ts exists in the src directory. This is strange because the error message indicated that  
  the file could not be found.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                          
  Maybe there's a discrepancy in the file system visibility between the shell and Node.js environments in this execution  
  context. To circumvent this, I'll write the server code to ./src/index.ts in the shell environment instead.             
                                                                                                                          
  Here is the server code that will be written to the file:

  Let's run the code to write this to ./src/index.ts.

  Great, I've just written the basic Express server code to ./src/index.ts. You now have a Node.js project set up with    
  Express and TypeScript.

  ┃                              Next Step: Implement the Game Logic (tic-tac-toe rules).                              ┃

  In order to implement the game logic, we need to decide how we will represent the game state, and the rules for         
  winning and losing the game.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                          
  Before we get to the code, let's understand the rules of Tic Tac Toe, which are quite simple:                           
                                                                                                                          
   1 The game is played on a 3x3 grid.                                                                                    
   2 The first player uses "X" as his marker, while the second player uses "O".                                           
   3 Players take turns in placing their markers on the grid.                                                             
   4 The first player to have 3 of his markers in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.                  
   5 When all spots on the grid is filled and no player has 3 markers in a row, it's a draw.                              
                                                                                                                          
  In our representation:                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                          
   • We'll create a 2D array of size 3x3 to hold the game state. Each entry can either be 'X', 'O' or null (denoting      
     unoccupied).                                                                                                         
   • We'll create a function placeMark which takes a player (either 'X' or 'O'), and coordinates for row and column, and  
     places the mark if the cell is unoccupied.                                                                           
   • We'll create a function checkWinner to determine if there is a winner. This function checks all 8 possible winning   
     combinations (3 horizontal lines, 3 vertical, and 2 diagonals).                                                      
                                                                                                                          
  Let's begin by creating the game logic. In future steps, we will connect this logic to our Express server.

  It appears that we encountered a similar error as before with Node.js not being able to see the ./src/game.ts file      
  that was just created. As before, I will write the game logic code to ./src/game.ts in the shell environment instead.   
                                                                                                                          
  In our game logic code, we:                                                                                             
                                                                                                                          
   • Initialize the board as a 3x3 grid, filled with underscores (which denote blank spaces).                             
   • Initialize the currentPlayer as 'X'.                                                                                 
   • Define a placeMark function that takes in a player and coordinates, and places the player's mark at the specified    
     coordinates if the location is unoccupied.                                                                           
   • Define a checkWinner function that checks all possible winning combinations to determine if there is a winner.

  Great! I've written game logic to ./src/game.ts. This code should provide the basic mechanics for a tic-tac-toe game.

  The next step is to modify our express server script to use this game logic. Specifically, we want to create HTTP       
  endpoints for our Tic-Tac-Toe game that allow users to:

   • Place a mark on the board                                                                                            
   • Check who won                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                          
  To do this, we will import our game module into the Express server file and add new routes.                             
                                                                                                                          
  Let's modify the index.ts file to include these updates.                                                                
                                                                                                                          >                                                                                                                           
  I apologize for the inconvenience. It looks like the formatting issues are causing problems when writing to the files.  
  Let's correct that and rewrite the game logic and server code correctly.                                                
                                                                                                                          
  We'll create multi-line strings for the game logic and server code, and write these to their respective files using     
  the shell environment. In addition, we'll ensure that double quotes are not escaped so that the format is valid

  }                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                          
  export { placeMark, checkWinner, board, currentPlayer };' > src/game.ts                                                 
                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                          
  Great! We've rewritten the game logic to ./src/game.ts and the server code to ./src/index.ts using the correct format.  
                                                                                                                          
  Now that we have the game logic and server set up, we can move onto the next step which is connecting the two by        
  creating HTTP endpoints that link to our Tic Tac Toe game functions which are placeMark and checkWinner. This will      
  allow our game state to be manipulated and viewed over HTTP.                                                            
                                                                                                                          
  We'll import the game logic from game.ts into index.ts, then:                                                           
                                                                                                                          
   • Create an endpoint at GET /game to return the current game state and the current player.                             
   • Create an endpoint at POST /game to place a mark on the board.                                                       
   • Create an endpoint at GET /game/winner to return the winner of the game.                                             
                                                                                                                          
  Let's update index.ts to implement these changes. As a part of writing this process, we will create a JSON response     
  object that the client will use to understand the game state. The object will contain the information about the         
  current state of the board, the current player, and the winner of the game. If the game has not been won yet, the       
  winner will be represented as an empty string. If the game is won, the winner will be represented as the winning        
  player 'X' or 'O'.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                          
  Please note that implementing this will require us to install the body-parser middleware for Express to handle the      
  JSON payload in the POST /game request. We will install this middleware using npm.                                      
                                                                                                                          
  Let's start with this next step by updating index.ts.                                                                   
                                                                                                                          >                                                                                                                           
  Sure, in order to render the board in the browser from its state on the server, we should create an HTML page and use   
  JavaScript on the client-side to fetch the board state from the server and update the HTML accordingly.                 
                                                                                                                          
  The steps in our plan would therefore be:                                                                               
                                                                                                                          
   1 Update the server code in index.ts to serve an HTML page when accessing the root URL /.                              
   2 Create an HTML page with grids representing the tic tac toe board and include JavaScript to fetch the game state     
     from the server and update the grid accordingly.                                                                     
   3 The JavaScript code will call the GET /game endpoint to retrieve the game state and POST /game to change the game    
     state.                                                                                                               
   4 We will then return this HTML page when accessing / on our server.                                                   
                                                                                                                          
  The HTML/JavaScript code will be added to index.ts all in one code block in a manner like so:                           
                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                          
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {                                                                                           
     res.send(`

  Let's start with updating index.ts to serve an HTML page when the root URL / is accessed. This HTML page will           
  initially be barebones, and we will later add to it the HTML/JavaScript necessary to render and interact with the tic   
  tac toe board.

  and it updates the game state on the server accordingly.                                                                
                                                                                                                          
  To view the board, navigate to 'http://localhost:3000/' in your web browser. The game state is updated every time a     
  cell is clicked, and a fetch is made to the server to update the game state and redraw the board.                       
                                                                                                                          
  Remember that you must run your server with the command npx ts-node src/index.ts before you can see the game in your    
  browser.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                          
  Also please keep in mind that this is a very basic version of the game. It does not handle end of the game (when        
  someone wins or the game is a draw). There are also many ways this interface could be improved, such as by adding a     
  visual indication of which player's turn it is or displaying a message when the game ends.                              
                                                                                                                          
  If you want to add more features or improvements, you can continue expanding on this basic structure.                   
                                                                                                                          > 
                                                                                                                          
  cat src/text.ts                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                          
  export function textFoo(){                                                                                              
  return "hello foo"                                                                                                      
  }                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  We can certainly use the text returned by the function textFoo from src/text.ts as the title of the game. First, we     
  need to import this function into src/index.ts.                                                                         
                                                                                                                          
  We'll then update the src/index.ts file to insert the text returned by textFoo where we render the HTML response for    
  the game. This will set it as the title of the game.                                                                    
                                                                                                                          
  Let's update src/index.ts with these changes.

  Perfect! I have updated the src/index.ts file to use the text returned by the function textFoo() as the title of the    
  game.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                          
  Now when you run the server again and navigate to 'http://localhost:3000/' in your web browser, you will see the title  
  of the game is now "hello foo".                                                                                         
                                                                                                                          
  Remember, to see these changes you must run your server with the command npx ts-node src/index.ts before you can see    
  the game in your browser.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                          >
