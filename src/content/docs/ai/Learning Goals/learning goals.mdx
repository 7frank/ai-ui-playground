## Tooling for DS & DE

- What tools do I know of
- What tools does the internet know of
- What tools do colleagues know of


The goal:

- is to have a general understanding of what works and what not.
- As well as get in touch with others and share ideas.

## data engineering

- [fundamentals-of-data-engineering](https://saracus.com/synvert-saracus-blog/10-dinge-die-ich-beim-lesen-von-fundamentals-of-data-engineering-gelernt-habe/#)
  https://chat.openai.com/share/14184316-4969-475c-a790-3e890648098c
- https://chat.openai.com/c/b21b699d-829d-4f9d-a174-bd1ffc47368b
The goal:

- effectively work with these tools comming from a DevOps perspective

### pipelines (architecture?) Data Transformation Pipelines?

- [airflow / dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-airflow)
- aws redshift / google bigquery
- DBT
- bigquery

## data science

- developing

  - python/conda/mamba and maybe other DSLs
  - frameworks (pytorch, fastai, etc)
  - visualize data (matplotlib,sympy, plotly and others)
  - Jupiter Notebooks
  - nb_Dev

https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels

The goal:

- First and foremost we need a basic tooling to get started
- effectively work with these tools from a developer perspective
- Identify risks related to software development versionierung (e.g. versioning of dependencies)

## market analysis

We did a [brief search of markets](../Markets/1%20Introduction.md) with the bot https://chat.openai.com/c/1370e49f-2e52-4ebd-9eef-fd33b0948b25


## large language models

> Pros / Cons

The Goal:

- Find options for self hosting, for data security reasons

### prompt engineering

> https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/

The goal:

- How to write good prompts ("let me google that")
- How to solve daily tastks more efficiently
  - Define what daily tasks are
    - e.g. code documentation

Technische Topics

- How to use LLMs from inside of software
  - How to generate Prompts
- How to cache questions / response to save time / money
  - Does it make sense to ask GPT twice for two similar questions or should we use a cache for that
