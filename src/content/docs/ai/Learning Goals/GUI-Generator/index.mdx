import img1 from "./input.png"
import out1 from "./output1.png"
import out2 from "./output2.png"
import { Picture } from 'astro:assets';

This is the input we drew. This was sent to the ai model and converted to html:

<Picture src={img1} formats={['avif', 'webp']} alt="Input image originally svg" />

Depending on the Notes that we provided the output changed noticably
<Picture src={out1} formats={['avif', 'webp']} alt="The first output" />



For example in this image we added that hthere explicitly should be a background image
<Picture src={out2} formats={['avif', 'webp']} alt="The first output" />
