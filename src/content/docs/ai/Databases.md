  - can we create a graph of the topics in ai and then interactivly navigate that graph?




- Neo4j Bloom: This tool is designed for data analysts and provides an interactive way to explore Neo4j graphs. It supports text-based search and offers 'point-and-click' graph exploration, performant views of large graphs with custom styling, and the ability to edit your Neo4j graph visually.
- Neovis.js: A JavaScript library that builds graph visualizations from Neo4j data. It wraps around the Vis.js library and connects directly to the Neo4j instance for live data.

- Popoto.js: A community-driven JS library based on D3.js, it provides an interactive visual Cypher query builder with a direct Neo4j connection. It's also embeddable into webpages.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation Tools:    



## Example use case for testing the waters
  I  want to aggregate all data for a certain field from various datasources (e.g. wikipedia, web crawlers) and put that in my graph database, to be able to generate knowledge / distance graphs for a subtopic that helps navigating and understanding topics#
 
 - The result should be something searchable like  https://blinpete.github.io/wiki-graph/?lang=en&wordle=&query=Outline%20of%20artificial%20intelligence
 - talk with lin about how to approach such a thing
    - what is on the market, what is standard in terms of aggregation, cleaning (dbt could be somewhere around here)
### questions
- what tools are good data visualisation 
- what packages are are good data visualisation (python,js,other)
    - data in general
    - graph data
- any good and easy hosting plattforms for prototypes that do not have to worry about data security
