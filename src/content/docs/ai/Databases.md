title: Graph Database Tools in AI
---


This section covers tools and libraries that help visualize and interact with graph databases, especially in the context of AI.

## Visualization Tools for Neo4j Graph Database

- **Neo4j Bloom**: Ideal for data analysts, Neo4j Bloom allows interactive exploration of Neo4j graphs. It features a text-based search, intuitive graph navigation, and capabilities for visual editing and custom styling of large graph databases. Learn more at [Neo4j Bloom](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/15-tools-for-visualizing-your-neo4j-graph-database/).

- **Neovis.js**: This JavaScript library leverages the Vis.js library to create graph visualizations from Neo4j data, offering live data connection to Neo4j instances. More details are available on their GitHub page: [Neovis.js GitHub](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neovis.js).

- **Popoto.js**: A D3.js-based JavaScript library, Popoto.js provides an interactive Cypher query builder with Neo4j integration. It's suitable for embedding in web applications. Examples and documentation can be found here: [Popoto.js Examples](https://github.com/Nhogs/popoto-examples/blob/master/factual/readme.md).

## (1) Example Use Case: Aggregating AI-Related Data

To aggregate AI-related data from various sources (like Wikipedia or web crawlers) and visualize it in a graph database, consider tools that facilitate data aggregation, cleaning, and visualization.

- **Result Goal**: A searchable interface similar to [Wiki Graph](https://blinpete.github.io/wiki-graph/?lang=en&wordle=&query=Outline%20of%20artificial%20intelligence) for AI topics.


### Questions

- **Data Visualization Tools**: Research tools and packages (in Python, JavaScript, etc.) suitable for general data and specifically for graph data visualization.

- **Hosting Platforms for Prototypes**: Look for easy-to-use hosting platforms that are suitable for prototype testing and not stringent on data security.


- **Discussion with colleagues**: Explore market standards for data aggregation and cleaning. Tools like dbt might be relevant.

### Hosting for Testing Graph Databases
