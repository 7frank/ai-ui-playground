Similar to Obsidian GraphView, this page shows all relations of documents.In its current state it is only somewhat useful.
Future interations might help navigating complex topics.

import GraphView from "../../../components/GraphView/GraphView.svelte";
import NodesView from "../../../components/GraphView/NodesView.svelte";

import graphData from "../../../../graph.json";
import fooData from "../../../../foo.json";

<GraphView
  graph={graphData}
  onClick={(el) => console.log("clicked", el)}
  client:load
/>

<hr/>
<NodesView
  graph={fooData}
  onClick={(el) => console.log("clicked", el)}
  client:load
