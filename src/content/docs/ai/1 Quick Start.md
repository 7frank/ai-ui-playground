- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_getting_started.asp


The tensorflow and pytorch websites have their own tutorials:

- https://pytorch.org/tutorials/
- https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification

fast.ai again has great video tutorials

- https://course.fast.ai/

Kaggle also has a series about ds and ml 

- https://www.kaggle.com/learn


In the field of computer vision OpenCV might be something you want to look up
- https://learnopencv.com/3d-lidar-object-detection/

## I need advanced sources


You will find almost anything but should know what you are looking for. Like their name suggests, you will find a vast amount of papers accompanied with code, notebooks, etc. e.g. [cifar-10](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cifar-10)
- https://paperswithcode.com

fast.ai course has a 2nd video course, which goes deeper into the field.
