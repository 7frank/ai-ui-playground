title: Roadmap from X to Y
---

In here we outline how to transition from some technical role to more data driven variants. This is influenced by the [Roles](./Roles.mdx) and Skills that we think are required. It is also to some degree influenced by the complexity of the scope and the liimited resources (e.g. time) for such a transition.



##  How to implement ML

The article from t3n discusses how companies can meaningfully implement machine learning (ML) beyond the hype. It emphasizes the need for **companies to critically evaluate potential use cases** and the practicality of ML in their organization. The author, Ryan Chaves, a data scientist, advises a **pragmatic** approach, focusing on **specific ML** models that can create **real value for businesses**. The key steps include understanding the concepts of AI, ML, and generative AI; assessing the current state of the company; ensuring quality data; **involving various departments** in the implementation process; and considering external support for small and medium-sized enterprises. The article also highlights the importance of scalability and developing a collaborative strategy across departments for successful integration of ML models into business processes.

# Potential implementation for specific role

- [From Backend Engineer to ML Engineer](https://medium.com/israeli-tech-radar/from-backend-engineer-to-ml-engineer-roadmap-436cb3bf3c7)

The article outlines the roadmap for a backend engineer to transition into an ML engineer role. It **emphasizes** the importance of ML engineers in **integrating data science models into production**, focusing on skills like data engineering, software engineering practices, MLOps, and monitoring. Key areas for skill development include Python proficiency, understanding data tools and SQL, familiarity with ML libraries, and basic concepts of machine learning. The role of ML engineers is unique, blending software engineering with ML modeling, and requires continuous learning due to evolving technologies.
