We've asked the bot: https://chat.openai.com/share/2825c69e-a51b-42ad-be81-a900f0743251

These are the results:


## General Lerning Path

>  We have someone who is knowledgeable in field X, and we want to have a learning path that they can work in field Y.

- Identify Core Skills and Knowledge in Field Y: Research and list the essential skills, knowledge areas, and competencies required in field Y. This could involve technical skills, theoretical knowledge, soft skills, and industry-specific practices.
- Assess Current Skills and Knowledge: Evaluate the individual's current skills and knowledge in field X. Identify transferable skills and knowledge that are relevant to field Y.
- Gap Analysis: Compare the required skills for field Y with the individual's current skillset to identify gaps. This will help in focusing the learning path on areas that need development.
- Set Learning Objectives: Based on the gap analysis, set clear, achievable learning objectives. These should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
- Choose Learning Resources and Methods: Select appropriate learning resources such as online courses, books, workshops, mentorship, internships, or hands-on projects. Consider a blend of theoretical learning and practical application.
- Create a Structured Plan: Organize the learning resources and methods into a structured plan. This plan should have a logical sequence, starting from foundational concepts and gradually advancing to more complex topics.
- Incorporate Feedback Mechanisms: Include regular assessments, feedback sessions, or progress reviews in the learning path. This will help in tracking progress and making adjustments as needed.
- Flexibility and Adaptation: Be prepared to modify the learning path based on the learner's progress, changes in field Y, or new insights about the learner's strengths and weaknesses.
- Peer and Community Engagement: Encourage engagement with peers or professionals already working in field Y. This could involve joining professional groups, forums, or networking events.
- Practical Experience: If possible, incorporate real-world projects or hands-on experience in field Y. This could be through internships, volunteer work, or small-scale projects.
- Review and Iterate: Regularly review the learning path and update it as necessary, considering the learner's progress, feedback, and any changes in the industry standards or requirements of field Y.

# Summary

Given a more detalied list of skills and education, as well as a more focused target area, this could prove to be a starting tool for learning paths tailored to the **individual**


Considerations
- create a flow that automates this based on a given set of proficiencies
- *prompt engineering* 
    - re-evaluate the actual learning items that we want to use for the prompts
    - give the llm a "system" prompt `you are 10x personal educator ...`
    - restrict resources for learning a specific skill (e.g. time to learn the skill)
    - prevent model from spitting out to broad / general information
