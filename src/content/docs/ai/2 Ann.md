title: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
---

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a cornerstone of machine learning, inspired by the biological neural networks in animal brains. They are computing systems designed to simulate the way humans learn and process information. ANNs consist of interconnected nodes, mimicking biological neurons, which process and transmit information.

The fundamental unit of an ANN is the neuron, or node, which receives input, processes it, and generates output. The connections between neurons, known as weights, are adjusted during training to improve the network's performance.

ANNs learn through a process called training, where they adjust their weights based on the input data they receive and the desired output. This learning process often involves a method called backpropagation, where the network adjusts its weights to minimize the difference between its output and the true output.

There are various types of ANNs, each suited to different tasks. For example, [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](/ai-ui-playground/ai/computer-vision/cnns/)  are used for image processing, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are effective for sequence data like text or time series.

The application of ANNs is vast, covering areas like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and even complex decision-making tasks. Their ability to learn from large amounts of data and identify patterns makes them a powerful tool in the field of artificial intelligence.

Below are some of the NN that are not fruther discussed in our context:

## Fields of NN

[here](./Basics/Fields.mdx) you will find a more comprehensive overview of all fields.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  This involves understanding, interpreting, and generating human language by machines. It's used in chatbots, translation services, and sentiment analysis.

### Computer Vision
 AI in this field interprets and understands visual information from the world, used in image recognition, autonomous vehicles, and facial recognition systems.

### Collaborative Filtering
Used in recommendation systems to filter items (like movies, books, products) based on past interactions of users. It's widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.


### Robotics
 AI in robotics enables machines to perform complex tasks, often in environments unsuitable for humans. This includes manufacturing robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles.


## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):

    Use Case: Suited for sequential data such as time series, speech, and text. They are used in tasks like speech recognition, language modeling, and machine translation.
    Key Features: Have loops in their architecture to maintain information in 'memory' over time, allowing them to process sequences of data.

## Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs):

    Use Case: A more advanced form of RNNs, effective at learning long-range dependencies in sequential data. Commonly used in complex sequence modeling tasks like language translation and speech synthesis.
    Key Features: Include special units called memory cells that can maintain information in memory for long periods, addressing the vanishing gradient problem common in standard RNNs.

## Autoencoders:

    Use Case: Used for unsupervised learning tasks, such as dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and generative models. They are particularly useful in image denoising, anomaly detection, and data compression.
    Key Features: Consist of an encoder that compresses the input and a decoder that reconstructs the input from the compressed representation.

## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):

    Use Case: Widely used in generative tasks like image generation, image super-resolution, and style transfer. They have also found applications in data augmentation and synthetic data generation.
    Key Features: Comprise two parts â€“ a generator that creates samples and a discriminator that distinguishes between generated and real samples, trained simultaneously in a competitive manner.

## Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):

    Use Case: Designed for data that is represented as graphs, such as social networks, molecule structures, and recommendation systems.
    Key Features: Capable of capturing the dependencies in graph structures, they update the representation of a node based on its neighbors.

## Transformer Networks:

    Use Case: Beyond their use in language models, transformers are also adapted for various tasks like image recognition (Vision Transformers, ViT) and multimodal tasks (combining text and images).
    Key Features: Relies on self-attention mechanisms to process sequences of data, whether it's text, image patches, or other forms of structured data.
