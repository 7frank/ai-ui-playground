This is the input we drew. This was sent to the ai model and converted to html:

<Picture src={img1} formats={['avif', 'webp']} alt="Input image originally svg" />

Depending on the Notes that we provided the output changed noticably

For example in the second image we added that there explicitly should be a background image

Also the pure html will most probably break css due to style bleeding
