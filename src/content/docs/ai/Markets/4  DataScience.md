## developing

  - python/conda/mamba and maybe other DSLs
  - frameworks (pytorch, fastai, etc)
  - visualize data (matplotlib,sympy, plotly and others)
  - Jupiter Notebooks
  - nb_Dev

https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels

The goal:

- First and foremost we need a basic tooling to get started
- effectively work with these tools from a developer perspective
- Identify risks related to software development versionierung (e.g. versioning of dependencies)

## large language models

> Pros / Cons

The Goal:

- Find options for self hosting, for data security reasons

### prompt engineering

> https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/

The goal:

- How to write good prompts ("let me google that")
- How to solve daily tastks more efficiently
  - Define what daily tasks are
    - e.g. code documentation

Technische Topics

- How to use LLMs from inside of software
  - How to generate Prompts
- How to cache questions / response to save time / money
  - Does it make sense to ask GPT twice for two similar questions or should we use a cache for that
