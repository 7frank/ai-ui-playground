    Use Case: Primarily for image processing and computer vision tasks. They are adept at handling spatial hierarchy in images, making them ideal for tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
    Key Features: Use convolutional layers to extract features from images, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, and fully connected layers for classification or regression.

## Layer Types

There are many types of layers used to build Convolutional Neural Networks, but the ones you are most likely to encounter include:

### Convolutional (CONV)

### Activation (ACTor RELU, where we use the same or the actual activation function)

### Pooling (POOL)

### Fully connected (FC)

### Batch normalization (BN )

### Dropout (DO )

### Other
