> The easiest way to think about artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning and neural networks is to think of them as a series of AI systems from largest to smallest, each encompassing the next.
> 
> Artificial intelligence is the overarching system. Machine learning is a subset of AI. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, and neural networks make up the backbone of deep learning algorithms. It’s the number of node layers, or depth, of neural networks that distinguishes a single neural network from a deep learning algorithm, which must have more than three.

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: A broad field of computer science focused on creating smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI where systems learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
- **Deep Learning**: A specialized ML approach using neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in data.
- **Neural Networks**: Computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks in our brains, fundamental to deep learning.


## Overview of the Fields

Below you will find some graphs that can give you a glimps of what AI is about.

Follow this link,if you want to know more about the different [Fields of AI](./Fields.mdx).


For somewhat of an overview, you can use the relation graphs of the topic from wikipedia below.
They can provide you with a general understanding of what AI is as well as projects in this domain.
