To give you an idea of how much effort is needed to be able to work in one of the fields, below is a broad estimate:

### Understanding the Basics:
- **Deep Learning and Machine Learning**: For a complete beginner, getting a grasp of the basic concepts might take anywhere from 40 to 200 hours. This includes understanding fundamental algorithms, basic statistical concepts, and getting familiar with programming and tools necessary for implementing basic models.
- **Data Science**: A foundational understanding of data science, including basic statistics, data analysis, and visualization, might require an additional 50 to 100 hours.

### Supervised Work Level:
- **Deep Learning and Machine Learning**: With a basic understanding of core concepts and some hands-on practice, it might take approximately 200 to 500 hours of study and practice. This should equip you with enough knowledge to contribute to projects and perform tasks under supervision, where you can continue to learn from more experienced colleagues.
- **Data Science**: Similarly, reaching a level where you can effectively contribute to data science projects under supervision might require around 150 to 300 hours. This would include foundational knowledge in data analysis, statistics, and the use of relevant tools and software.

### Becoming Capable of Acting:
- **Deep Learning and Machine Learning**: To reach a level where one can independently handle projects or perform tasks effectively in these fields, it could take anywhere from 500 to 1000+ hours. This involves not only understanding advanced concepts but also gaining practical experience with real-world data, complex problem-solving, and perhaps specialization in certain areas.
- **Data Science**: Similarly, achieving proficiency in data science might require an additional several hundred hours, focused on more advanced statistical methods, complex data handling, and mastering various tools and languages like Python, R, SQL, etc.

## 

It's important to note that these are broad estimates and actual time can vary. For someone with a background in related fields like mathematics, statistics, or computer science, the learning curve might be shorter. On the other hand, those completely new to these concepts might need more time to assimilate the information.

Additionally, the learning process is often non-linear â€“ it involves revisiting concepts multiple times and continuous learning, especially given the fast-paced evolution of these fields. Practical experience, such as working on projects, internships, or contributing to open-source, can significantly enhance understanding and proficiency.

Therefore, while these hour estimates provide a rough guideline, the key to success in these areas is consistent and continuous learning, staying updated with the latest advancements, and practical application of knowledge.
