const epic=`
Epics are essentially broad, high-level descriptions of the desired outcomes or goals. They are too large to be completed in a single iteration or sprint and therefore need to be divided into more manageable pieces. Epics are used to organize work around a specific theme or feature set over multiple sprints.

Characteristics of an epic include:

    Broad in scope: Epics are wide-ranging and cover a significant piece of functionality or a major feature.
    Longer duration: They take more time to complete, often spanning several sprints or even across release cycles.
    Higher level: Epics provide a high-level understanding of the goal or objective without delving into the specifics of implementation.
    Breakdown: They are broken down into smaller user stories to facilitate planning, execution, and tracking.
`

const userStory=`
User Story

A user story, on the other hand, is a short, simple description of a feature from the perspective of the user or customer. User stories are much more specific and focused than epics. They describe a specific requirement or piece of functionality that can be completed within a single sprint. User stories are a way to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer.

Characteristics of a user story include:

    Specific and concise: User stories are detailed enough to allow for estimation and planning but open to interpretation to encourage collaboration and innovation.
    Short duration: They are small enough to be completed within a single sprint by a team.
    Follows a simple template: A common format for user stories is: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."
    Includes acceptance criteria: User stories typically include acceptance criteria that define the scope of the story and what is needed for the work to be accepted as complete.
