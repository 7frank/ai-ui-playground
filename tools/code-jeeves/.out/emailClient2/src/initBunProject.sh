# This function initializes a new Bun project.
#
# It creates a basic Bun project structure with the necessary initial files.
# No external utility functions are defined since the script remains concise.

initBunProject() {
    # Ensure Bun is installed
    if ! command -v bun &> /dev/null
    then
        echo "Bun could not be found. Please install Bun first."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Create a new project directory (optional prompt for directory name)
    echo "Enter your new Bun project name:"
    read projectName
    mkdir "$projectName"
    
    # Change to project directory
    cd "$projectName" || exit

    # Initialize a new Bun project here. 
    # This might involve creating initial files such as package.json or similar.
    # Since Bun is relatively new and its ecosystem rapidly evolving, 
    # the exact commands might change over time.
    # As of my last training data, a typical initialization could simply be:
    bun init
    
    echo "Bun project initialized successfully."
}

# Exporting the function in a shell script context doesn't apply like it would in other programming languages.
# However, you can ensure this script is sourced to make its functions available in other shell scripts or shell instances.

# Example to source this script from another shell script or terminal:
# source /path_to_this_script/init_bun_project.sh
