Given the file extension 'sh' in your request, it suggests that the desired output should be a shell script rather than involving a programming language that typically uses TSDoc or similar documentation styles. Shell scripts don't follow the same syntax or conventions as TypeScript or languages that utilize TSDoc. However, I'll adapt your requirements to fit a shell script context while trying to respect the spirit of your request by including inline comments, which serve as documentation in shell scripts.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# This function initializes a new Bun project.
#
# It creates a basic Bun project structure with the necessary initial files.
# No external utility functions are defined since the script remains concise.

initBunProject() {
    # Ensure Bun is installed
    if ! command -v bun &> /dev/null
    then
        echo "Bun could not be found. Please install Bun first."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Create a new project directory (optional prompt for directory name)
    echo "Enter your new Bun project name:"
    read projectName
    mkdir "$projectName"
    
    # Change to project directory
    cd "$projectName" || exit

    # Initialize a new Bun project here. 
    # This might involve creating initial files such as package.json or similar.
    # Since Bun is relatively new and its ecosystem rapidly evolving, 
    # the exact commands might change over time.
    # As of my last training data, a typical initialization could simply be:
    bun init
    
    echo "Bun project initialized successfully."
}

# Exporting the function in a shell script context doesn't apply like it would in other programming languages.
# However, you can ensure this script is sourced to make its functions available in other shell scripts or shell instances.

# Example to source this script from another shell script or terminal:
# source /path_to_this_script/init_bun_project.sh
```

This script follows shell scripting conventions and assumes Bun has a command line interface capable of initializing new projects, akin to npm or yarn in the Node.js ecosystem. Note, the preference for documentation style, interface, and type declaration don't directly apply to shell scripts, but comments have been added for clarity. The function is defined in a manner that, if this script were sourced from another, it would effectively "export" the function to the sourcing shell environment.
