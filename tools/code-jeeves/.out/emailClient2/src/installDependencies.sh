Given the file extension 'sh', it suggests that we create a shell script rather than typical source code in programming languages like TypeScript, JavaScript, etc. Since Shell script doesn't have a concept of exporting functions in the same way as those programming languages, I'll demonstrate how you might implement a shell script that defines a function to install npm dependencies, intended to be sourced or included in other scripts.

Filename: `installDependencies.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script provides a function to install npm dependencies.
# It's intended to be sourced into other scripts for re-use.

# Installs necessary npm packages.
installDependencies() {
  echo "Installing npm dependencies..."
  npm install
  echo "Dependencies installed."
}

# To allow this script to be sourced and its function used in other scripts,
# There's no action needed here to 'export' it, as it becomes available once sourced.
# Usage in other script after sourcing this file: installDependencies
```

Since the requirements implied a usage of conventions from programming languages that are not applicable to shell scripts (e.g., exporting functions, TSDoc comments), the provided script comments aim for clarity within the script's capabilities. Shell scripts do not have interfaces, types, or a native `export` system similar to JavaScript or TypeScript modules, but defining functions that can be reused by sourcing the script is a common pattern in shell scripting.
